This was created to show how the library works and how it works.
Dataset_Creator.py is the mine file a programmer uses to download
a raw, uncleaned dataset of their choosing. Noise can be added as well
as the conversion to npy. Image_rec.py is a base class than can be used 
for other image recognizers but is showed off with the apple_watermelon_banana
dataset. The scrapers are not to abuse the websites, but to showcase for a resume.
